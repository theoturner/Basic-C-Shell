# Basic C Shell

A rudimentary shell for directory navigation and setting environment variables.

Requires gcc.
To use, set your PATH and HOME variables in `profile`.
Next, compile using the makefile â€“ navigate to the shell directory and type:
```
make
```
You can now start the shell by typing:
```
./shell
```
